Hello, my name is Ryan Ruggiero. I'm a transfer student from Montclair State University, and my major is Architecture. I'm currently on sophmore standing, and I'm looking forward to a successful, propserous career here at NJIT.
One of my favorite hobbies is cars. I enjoy motorsports, and working on my miata.
NJIT is fun, but is also a very challenging school.
